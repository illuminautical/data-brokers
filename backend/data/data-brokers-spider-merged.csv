The following links are provided as an easy way for you to exercise these rights.  Alternatively, you can contact us for more information or to make a request regarding your Personal Information.  To ensure that we do not provide or delete your Personal Information in response to a fraudulent request, we will verify your identity prior to proceeding with your request.  In the event we are unable to verify your identity, we will not be able to proceed with a Right to Know request, and will proceed with a “Do Not Sell My Information” request in response to a Right to Delete request.
